## TRIGONOMETRY
**Trigonometry helps you understand any topic that involves distances, angles, or waves. The trig functions (sin, cos, and tan) show up all over science and engineering.** 

### RADIANS
1.	**What’s a “radian”?**: Discover another way to measure angles.  
	+ Units for measuring angle.  
	+ Circumference of circle = 2*Pi* r 
	+ 2*Pi* radian  = 360 degree.  hence 1 radian = 2 *Pi* x (1 radian) = 360
	+ 1 radian = 360/(2 *pi* ) == 57.29 degree.  
	+ 2 *Pi* radian = 360 degree, 180 degree = *Pi* radians and 90 degree is *Pi*/2 radians  
	+ 
2.	**Radian and degrees**: How to switch back and forth between units for angles.	
	+ Radian sotly denoted as 'rad'  
	+ straight angle (180) has *Pi* rad ; *Pi* rad = 180 hence *Pi* rad/ 180 and 180/ *pi* rad = 1  
	+ how many **radians** equal 270 degree ?
	+ 270 = 270 x 1 ; 270 x *pi* rad / 180 
	+ 270 = 270/180 x *Pi* rad == 3x 90/2 x90 x *Pi* rad 
	+ 3 *Pi*/2 rad is answer 
	+ how many **radians** equals 60 degree??  1/3 x *Pi* rad  
	+ How many **degrees** equal **2 Pi rad **??  its 360 degree as 1 Pi rad = 180 degree.  
	+ How many **degrees** equal Pi/4 rad?? its 45 degree  
	+ so when we have degrees that we need to convert to radians .. use **degree** x ** Pi rad /180 **   and radians to degree use **radians** x **180/ Pi rad**  
	+ 
	
3.	**Lengths of circular arcs**: A formula for arc length in terms of radius and angle.  
	+ circumference of circle with *r* is 2 Pi r  
	+ how many radians in complete circle = 2 Pi  
	+ in terms of *Theta* , whta fraction of the circumferece does this arc represent?  [ fraction = part/whole = *theta*/ 2 Pi  ]
	+ Length of a circuklar arc : r *theta*  ( workd only *theta* is measured in radians)  
	+ For a circle with **radius 4**, what's the length of a circular arc with an angle of **1.5 radians**??  4 x 1.5 = 6 
	+ 
4.	**Sectors**: Learn what a sector is, and a formula for finding its area.  
	+ a **sector** is part of a circle between two radii.  
	+ Area of the entrie circle = Pi r^2  
	+ the sector is *theta*/ 2 Pi of the circle. 
	+ what's the area of the yellow sector in terms of **r** and **theta** 1/2 r^2 *theta*  *theta* R^2 / 2 ( works only when *theta* measured in radians) 
	+ for a circle with radius 5 , what's the area of a sector with an angle of 0.8 radians? 10
