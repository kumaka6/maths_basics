## TRIGONOMETRY
**Trigonometry helps you understand any topic that involves distances, angles, or waves. The trig functions (sin, cos, and tan) show up all over science and engineering.** 

### RADIANS
1.	**What’s a “radian”?**: Discover another way to measure angles.  
2.	**Radian and degrees**: How to switch back and forth between units for angles.  
3.	**Lengths of circular arcs**: A formula for arc length in terms of radius and angle.  
4.	**Sectors**: Learn what a sector is, and a formula for finding its area. 

### TIG FUNCTIONS
1.	**Sides of right triangles**: Your friendly hypotenuses opposites, and adjacents.
2.	**Sine**: Your very first trig function. 
3.	**Cosine**: Along with sine, cosine is a fundamental trig function. 
4.	**Tangent**: Another important trig function (like sine and cosine). 
5.	**Components (and cops)**: Find legs of right triangles, and don’t get pulled over!  
6.	**Sec, Csc, and Cot**: Secant and friends (three more trig functions).
### SPECIAL ANGLES
1.	**45 degrees**: Calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 45 degrees. 
2.	**30/60 degree**: Calculate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 30 and 60 degrees.
