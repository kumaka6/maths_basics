## STATISTICS
**The math of data collection and analysis. Very useful for finding trends and making predictions!**


### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
1.	**Sensitivity and specificity**: Quantifying whether tests for disease are any good.
2.	**Predictive value**: If you test positive/negative what are your chances?
3.	**Cutoffs and ROCs**: Sensitivity vs specificity, cutoff selection, and ROC curves.
4.	**Prevalence**: How rare a disease is, and how it affects PPV and NPV.
