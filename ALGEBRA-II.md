## ALGEBRA II  
**Take the next step in Algebra! Here we'll introduce the most common functions you're likely to see, and different ways to describe functions.**


### REAL NUMBERS
1.	**Integers**: Whole numbers, positives, and negatives. 
	+ **Natural numbers** or **whole numbers** or positive numbers without decimal points.  (Non-negative integers) 
	+ **adding** whole numbers **always** gives a whole number.  
	+ **Integers** positive and negative numbers  
	+ **Adding** and **subtracting** integers always gives **integers** 
	+ **Multipying** integer would give us integer but **dividing** wont give integer   
	+ 
2.	**Rationals**: Numbers that are quotients of integers.  
	+ Numbers that can be written as a **quotient** of integers. a/b   
	+ Quotient is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers.  
	+ 7/7, -2/10 , -14/3  , 0.4 = 2/3 , 3.25 = 13/4 
	+ 2.5/1.5 = 5/3  
	+ **Adding** rationals **always** gives you a rational. 
	+ **Multiplying** rationals **always** gives you a rational. 
	+ **subtracting** rationals **always** gives you a rational. 
	+ **Dividing** rationals **always** gives you a rational (as long as not dividing by 0).  
	+ 
	
	
3.	**Irrationals**: Number that are NOT quotient of integers.  
	+ *Pi* is irrational = 3.14159...
	+ e ~ 2.71828...
	+ *square root of* 2 = 1.41421... ( as there is no positive integer solutions)  
	+ Prime factors of squares **always** come in pairs.  
	+ *square root of * 5, *pi* 
4.	**Real numbers**: All the rationals and the irrationals.  
	+ All the numbers on the number line. also includes rationals., irrationals 
	+ -9/7 (rational), 3/0 ( undefined) *square root of*15 (Irrational) and *square root of* -2 (imaginary)  
	+ **Adding , Subtratcing , Multiplying, Dividing ** reals always gives real. 
	+ 

### IMAGINARY AND COMPLEX NUMBERS
1.	**Imaginary numbers**: Their square are negative!  
	+ negative numbers do not have real square root.  
	+ i^2 = -1 , (imaginar); i = *square root of* -1
	+ evaluate 2i x 2i = 2.2.i.i = -4  hence *square root of*-4 = 2i because 2i by itself is -4  
	+ evaluate *square root of* -9 ; can be written as 3i.  
	+ simplify *square root of*-7 ?? Ans: i *square root of*7 ( i = *square root of*-1)  
	+ Simplify *square root of* -12.  Ans: i *square root of*12 and *sqrt of* 12 can be written as *sqrt of* 4 and 3 , *sqrt of *4 = 2 hence the ans is 2i *sqrt of* 3  
	+ *sqrt of* -45 = 3i *sqrt of*5  
	+ 
2.	**Working with imaginaries**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide imaginary numbers.  
	+ 2i + 5i = 7i 
	+ 9i - 3i = 6i 
	+ 2i - 13i = 11i 
	+ 3i x 3i = 3.3.i.i = -9  
	+ 4i x -5i = 20 
	+ -2i x -8i = -16  
	+ 14i/2 = 7i  
	+ 16i /4i = 4  
	+ 
3.	**Complex numbers**: Combining the real and the imaginary.  
	+ a number that can be written as a + bi ; a is real number and b is imaginary number.  
	+ -6+3i , 17, -8i , 0 
	+ **Re**(-6 + 3i ) = -6, the real part is -6  
	+ **Im**(-6+3i) = 3  
	+ 
4.	**The Complex plane**: A way to graph complex numbers.  
	+ Horizontal axis = Real axis, Vertical Imaginary axis  
	+ just like quadrinate plane , complex plane has 4 Quadrants  ( I, II, III, IV ) 
	+ 
5.	**Power of *i* .**: Raising *i* to positive and negative integer powers. 
	+ i^2 = -1  
	+ i^3 = i^2 . i = -i 
	+ i^4 = 1 
	+ i^ 5 = i == i^4 . i hence i 
	+ i^6 = i^5 .i = i^2 = -1 
	+ exponent is multiple of 4 always get 1 
	+ [ i, -1, -i , 1 ]  
	+ 
	+ i to the negative is same as 1 over i 
	+ i^-1 = 1/i^1  == i / -1 = -i 
	+ i^0 = 1 ,  
	+ [1, -i, -1, i]  
	+ 
	+ simplyfy (2i)^3 == 2^3 . i^3 = 8 . -i = -8i  
	+ 

### FUNCTIONS
1.	**Relations**: Sets of (x, y) coordinates.  
	+ A set of (x,y) pairs. or collection of x , y pairs, represened as graphs or in table.  
	+ some time can be written as y = x **equations**
	+ relations can be **inequalities**.. y > x 
	+ 
2.	**Functions**: Relations where each input gives exactly one output.  
	+ imagine x coordinates are input and y coordinates are outputs.  ;
	+ a **relation** that adds 2.   when x = 1, the y is 3, when x is 2 then y is 4, when x is 5, y is 7  
	+ A relation is a **function** if each **input** gives **exactly one output** 
	+ 
	+ 
3.	**Functional notation**: Explore what f(x) means, and evaluate functions.  
	+ f(x) (f of x) is = x- 2 
	+ squares g = g9x) 
4.	**Continuity and smoothness**: Some functions end and others keep going.  
	+ **Continuity** A function is **continuous** if you can draw it without picking up your pen.  
	+ A function is **smooth** if its **continuous** and doesn't have any points corners.  
	+ **Discontinuity** 
	+ 
5.	**Describing functions**: Make your own functions, and live to tell the tale.  
	+ **Positive, Negative,  Increasing, Decreasing, Monotonic  Maxima, Minima** 
	+ A function is **positive** where its outputs are **positive**  
	+ A function is **negative** where its outputs are **negative**  
	+ A function is **increasing** if *y* goes up.   
	+ A function is **decreasing** if *y* goes down.   
	+ If a function is **always increasing**, then its **monotonically increasing** and vise versa .  
	+ if a continuous function **increases** and then **decreases**, what happens in between? Maximum value.   **Local maxima**
	+ higher point for entire function is **global maxima**. 
	+ Local minima and Local maxima is called **extrema** 
	+ 

6.	**Concavity**: Math-talk for “curvy”.  
	+ A function is **concave up** if it's smiling.  
	+ A function is **concave down** if it's frowning.  
	+ A **point of inflection** is where a function switches concavity  
	+ 
	+ 
7.	**Odd and even functions**: Turns out functions can be “odd” and “even” too.  
	+ **Odd** numbers : 1, 3, 5, 7 , 9 
	+ **even** numbers : 21, 4 ,6 , 8, 10 
	+ **Odd function** when rotating 180 gives same shape.  
	+ **Even function** when its symetric across **Y axis** 
	+ f(x) = f(-x)  for Even functions  
	+ f(-x) = -f(-x)  fro Odd function
