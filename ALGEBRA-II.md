## ALGEBRA II  
**Take the next step in Algebra! Here we'll introduce the most common functions you're likely to see, and different ways to describe functions.**


### REAL NUMBERS
1.	**Integers**: Whole numbers, positives, and negatives.
2.	**Rationals**: Numbers that are quotients of integers.
3.	**Irrationals**: Number that are NOT quotient of integers.
4.	**Real numbers**: All the rationals and the irrationals.

### IMAGINARY AND COMPLEX NUMBERS
1.	**Imaginary numbers**: Their square are negative!
2.	**Working with imaginaries**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide imaginary numbers.
3.	**Complex numbers**: Combining the real and the imaginary.
4.	**The Complex plane**: A way to graph complex numbers.
5.	**Power of *i* .**: Raising *i* to positive and negative integer powers. 

### FUNCTIONS
1.	**Relations**: Sets of (x, y) coordinates.
2.	**Functions**: Relations where each input gives exactly one output.
3.	**Functional notation**: Explore what f(x) means, and evaluate functions.
4.	**Continuity and smoothness**: Some functions end and others keep going. 
5.	**Describing functions**: Make your own functions, and live to tell the tale. 
6.	**Concavity**: Math-talk for “curvy”.  
7.	**Odd and even functions**: Turns out functions can be “odd” and “even” too.
