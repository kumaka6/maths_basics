# ALGEBRA

* addition , subtraction, multiplication , division

### ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
1. **Number line**: locating integer and non-integers on the number line  
  + Integers (positive and negative), floating numbers ( decimal numbers).  
2. **Addition**: Using the number line to add numbers
3. **Subtraction**: Moving left on the number line
4. **Adding negatives**: What happens when you add negative numbers?
5. **Substracting negatives**: Turns out it's addition!
6. **Absolute value**: The 'size' of a number, or how far it is from zero.
7. **Number line distance**: Ways to find the distance between any two numbers.

**NOTES**
```
'product' is what we get when multiply numbers.    3*5 = 15, 15 is the product.
'quotient' is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 6/3 = 2, 2 is the quotient.
'absolute' value is how far from '0' zero.    |-1| = 1, the absolute value is 1
negative + negative is positive (symbol). -3 - (-6) = -3 
```

### MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
1. **Multiplication**: multiplying positive numbers, in any order.
  + 4*7 = 28, 4 times 7 is 28.  
2. **Multiplying by 1 and 0** : Discover what happens when you multiply by 1 and 0.  
3. **Division**: Dividing positive number and ways to think about it.
  + evaluate quotient
4. **Dividing by 0**: An operation you just can't perform.

5. **order of operations**: is there more than one way to evaluate an expression?
	+ **left to right**
	+ perform **multiplication** and **division** before **addition** and **subtraction**.
	+ evaluate what's in parenthesis first.
	+ **PMADS**
	+ **PEMDAS**
6. **Distributive law**: Getting rid of parenthesis when you add and multiply.  
	+ 3 * (6+4) = 3*6 + 3*4 = 30  
	+ 3 *(7-2) = 3*7 - 3*2 = 15  
	+ 5 *(6+5-2) = 5*6 + 5*5 - 5*2 = 45  
7. **Multiplying negatives**: what happens when you multiply  negative together?
	+ negative times a positive results in a negative.
	+ negative times negative results in positive
	+ positive times positive results in positive
8. **Dividing negative**: what happens when you divide negative numbers?  
	+ -14/2 = -7 is (2*-7) = -14
	+ 14/-2 = -7 is (-2 * -7) = 14
	+ you can pull minus signs out of quotient.
	+ minus sign by minus sign cancelled out negative  
9. **Distributing Negative**: Distributing a negative flips the sign.
	+ -2.7 + 2.4 = -6
	+ addition -> Substraction
	+ Substraction -> addition
10. **Brackets and braces**: what to do when you have too many parenthesis?  
	+ evaluate innermost parenthesis and work your way out  
	+ outer parenthesis are often written as brackets or braces 
11. **Finding the average**: discover how to find the 'average' of numbers.  
	+ divide sum by numbers
