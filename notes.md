## ALGEBRA

* addition , subtraction, multiplication , division

### ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
* **Number line**: locating integer and non-integers on the number line  
  + Integers (positive and negative), floating numbers ( decimal numbers).  
* **Addition**: Using the number line to add numbers
* **Subtraction**: Moving left on the number line
* **Adding negatives**: What happens when you add negative numbers?
* **Substracting negatives**: Turns out it's addition!
* **Absolute value**: The 'size' of a number, or how far it is from zero.
* **Number line distance**: Ways to find the distance between any two numbers.

**NOTES**
```
'product' is what we get when multiply numbers.    3*5 = 15, 15 is the product.
'quotient' is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 6/3 = 2, 2 is the quotient.
'absolute' value is how far from '0' zero.    |-1| = 1, the absolute value is 1
negative + negative is positive (symbol). -3 - (-6) = -3 
```

### MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
* **Multiplication**: multiplying positive numbers, in any order.
  + 4*7 = 28, 4 times 7 is 28.  
* **Multiplying by 1 and 0** : Discover what happens when you multiply by 1 and 0.
* **Division**: Dividing positive number and ways to think about it.
  + evaluate quotient
* **Dividing by 0**: An operation you just can't perform.

* **order of operations**: is there more than one way to evaluate an expression?
	+ **left to right**
	+ perform **multiplication** and **division** before **addition** and **subtraction**.
	+ evaluate what's in parenthesis first.
	+ **PMADS**
	+ **PEMDAS**
* **Distributive law**: Getting rid of parenthesis when you add and multiply.  
	+ 3 * (6+4) = 3*6 + 3*4 = 30  
	+ 3 *(7-2) = 3*7 - 3*2 = 15  
	+ 5 *(6+5-2) = 5*6 + 5*5 - 5*2 = 45  
* **Multiplying negatives**: what happens when you multiply  negative together?
