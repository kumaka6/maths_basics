### ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
1. **Number line**: locating integer and non-integers on the number line  
	+ Integers (positive and negative), floating numbers (decimal numbers).  
2. **Addition**: Using the number line to add numbers
3. **Subtraction**: Moving left on the number line
4. **Adding negatives**: What happens when you add negative numbers?
5. **Substracting negatives**: Turns out it's addition!
6. **Absolute value**: The 'size' of a number, or how far it is from zero.
7. **Number line distance**: Ways to find the distance between any two numbers.

**NOTES**
```
'product' is what we get when multiply numbers.    3*5 = 15, 15 is the product.
'quotient' is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 6/3 = 2, 2 is the quotient.
'absolute' value is how far from '0' zero.    |-1| = 1, the absolute value is 1
negative + negative is positive (symbol). -3 - (-6) = -3 
```

### MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION

	+ 3 *(7-2) = 3*7 - 3*2 = 15  
	+ 5 *(6+5-2) = 5*6 + 5*5 - 5*2 = 45  
7. **Multiplying negatives**: what happens when you multiply  negative together?
	+ negative times a positive results in a negative.
	+ negative times negative results in positive
	+ positive times positive results in positive
8. **Dividing negative**: what happens when you divide negative numbers?  
	+ -14/2 = -7 is (2*-7) = -14
	+ 14/-2 = -7 is (-2 * -7) = 14
	+ you can pull minus signs out of quotient.
	+ minus sign by minus sign cancelled out negative  
9. **Distributing Negative**: Distributing a negative flips the sign.
	+ -2.7 + 2.4 = -6
	+ addition -> Substraction
