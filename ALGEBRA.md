### ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
1. **Number line**: locating integer and non-integers on the number line  
	+ Integers (positive and negative), floating numbers (decimal numbers).  
2. **Addition**: Using the number line to add numbers
3. **Subtraction**: Moving left on the number line
4. **Adding negatives**: What happens when you add negative numbers?
5. **Substracting negatives**: Turns out it's addition!
6. **Absolute value**: The 'size' of a number, or how far it is from zero.
7. **Number line distance**: Ways to find the distance between any two numbers.

**NOTES**
```
'product' is what we get when multiply numbers.    3*5 = 15, 15 is the product.
'quotient' is a quantity produced by the division of two numbers. 6/3 = 2, 2 is the quotient.
'absolute' value is how far from '0' zero.    |-1| = 1, the absolute value is 1
negative + negative is positive (symbol). -3 - (-6) = -3 
```

### MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
1. **Multiplication**: multiplying positive numbers, in any order.
	+ 4*7 = 28, 4 times 7 is 28.  
2. **Multiplying by 1 and 0** : Discover what happens when you multiply by 1 and 0.  
3. **Division**: Dividing positive number and ways to think about it.
	+ evaluate quotient.
4. **Dividing by 0**: An operation you just can't perform.

5. **order of operations**: is there more than one way to evaluate an expression?
	+ **left to right**
	+ perform **multiplication** and **division** before **addition** and **subtraction**.
	+ evaluate what's in parenthesis first.
	+ **PMADS**
	+ **PEMDAS**
6. **Distributive law**: Getting rid of parenthesis when you add and multiply.  
	+ 3 * (6+4) = 3*6 + 3*4 = 30  
	+ 3 *(7-2) = 3*7 - 3*2 = 15  
	+ 5 *(6+5-2) = 5*6 + 5*5 - 5*2 = 45  
7. **Multiplying negatives**: what happens when you multiply  negative together?
	+ negative times a positive results in a negative.
	+ negative times negative results in positive
	+ positive times positive results in positive
8. **Dividing negative**: what happens when you divide negative numbers?  
	+ -14/2 = -7 is (2*-7) = -14
	+ 14/-2 = -7 is (-2 * -7) = 14
	+ you can pull minus signs out of quotient.
	+ minus sign by minus sign cancelled out negative  
9. **Distributing Negative**: Distributing a negative flips the sign.
	+ -2.7 + 2.4 = -6

	+ outer parenthesis are often written as brackets or braces 
11. **Finding the average**: discover how to find the 'average' of numbers.  
	+ divide sum by numbers

### FACTORING
1.	**Factors**: Dividing by a factor always gives you a whole number. 
	+ factor what yields integer when divided. (positive factors & negative)
	+ 15/3 = 5 here 3 is factor of 15 and 5 is integer.
	+ 15/6 = 2.5 hence 6 is not a factor.
	+ Even: 2 4 6 8 & Odd: 1 3 5 7
	+ Factors are pair of numbers that can multiply any given number completely and yeilds interger.
2.	**Prime numbers**: Their only factors are 1 and themselves.  
	+ The only positive factors are 1 and the numer itself.
	+ 2,3,5, 11, 31 are **prime** numbers
	+ smallest prime is 2. (1 itself is not prime number, is know as a unit)
	+ **Composite** : has factors other than 1 and the number itself. 
	+ how to determine big numbers whether prime or composite?? Primes are commonly used in **Cryptography**.
3.	**Factoring out**: Pulling out common factors using the distributive law. 
	+ 3x2 + 3x8 = 3(2+8). undistributing 3 is factoring out. we factored out 3.
	+ 4x6 + 4x7 = 4(6+7) = 4x13
	+ 6x5 + 6x2 - 6x3 = 6(5+2-3) = 6(4) ; common factor is 6
	+ 5x8 - 8x1 = 8(5-1) = 8(4); common factor is 8.  
	+ **Distributi law in backwards.**
4.	**Factoring out negative**: Flip the signs when you factor out negative numbers.  
	+ when you factor out a negative, flip the signs.
	+ -3(7-5) = -3x7 + 3x5  
5.	**Greatest common factor**: the biggest factor that numbers have in common. 
	+ **common factors** is common between two numbers  
	+ **Greatest common factor** is which among common factor is biggest. aka **GCF**  
	+ GCF of 24 & 42 is 6.  
6.	**Relatively prime**: When two numbers have no common factors.  
	+ When their GCF is 1 : **Coprime**  or **relatively prime**  
7.	**Euclid's algorithm**: A 2000-year-old way to calculate the GCF.  
	+ to find out GCF
	+ Keep replacing the **bigger** number with the **difference**. When the numbers are **equal**, that's the **GCF**.
8.	**Multiples**: What you get when you multiply numbers by integer.  
	+ Multiplying a number by an integer gives you a **multiple** of that number. 
	+ 10x9 = 90 is a **multiple** of 10.  
	+ Every number is multples of itself.  
	+ 0 also Multiples
	+ Multiple & Factors are closely related. 18 is **multiple** of 6 and 6 is **factor** of 18.
9.	**Least common multiple**: The smallest multiple number have in common.
	+ **Common multiples** Positive multiples numbers have in common.
	+ **LCM** is **Least common multiple**.



### FRACTIONS
1.	**Intro to fractions**: Draw and compare fractions and convert to decimals.
	+ 63/7 = 9, however 1/7 =??, fraction.
	+ 1/4 is "a fourth", so 3/4 is three fourth. 
	+ 3/4 = 3 x 1/4 like wise 4/6 = 4 x 1/6.
	+ 4/6 == 2/3 ; **numerator** is 2 and **denominator** is 3
	+ Fraction 4/6 = Decimals 0.66666...
	+ 3/6 = 0.5  
2.	**Multiplying 	fractions**: What’s ½ times 3/5? Learn the trick in this lesion!  
	+ 1/2 x 10 = 5
	+ 1/3 x 12 = 4 & 2/3 x 12 = 8
	+ 1/2 x 3/5 = 3/10
	+ multiply numerators together and denominators together. 
	+ 3/4 x 5/7 = 15/28  
	
3.	**Comparing fractions**: How to tell when fractions are equal, or which is bigger.  
	+ 3/4 == 6/8
	+ when **cross-multiplying** fractions, if the products are equal then the fractions are **equal**  
	+ 2/3 = 8/12 ; 2x 12 =24 & 3x8 = 24.
	+ when **cross-multiplying** fractions, the **numerator with the bigger product** tells you the bigger fraction. (only useful for **positive** fractions!  
	+ 8/12 < 3/4 because,  8x4 =32 and 3x12 =36.  
	
4.	**Cancellation**: Simplifying fractions by removing common factors. 
	+ Whenever a numerator and denominator have **common factors**, the factors **cancel out**.
	+ 3x(372-145)/4x(372-145) = 3/4  
	+ 7x5x5/7x5x8 = 5/8
	+ cancelling out works only when its multiplication (donot cancell out when its addition or substraction of fractions).  
	+ 7/7x2 = 1/2

5. 	**Adding fractions**: Add and subtract fractions using common denominators. 
	+ 3/8 + 2/8 = 5/8 the sum of numerator and same denominator.  
	+ 5/12 + 1/3 = 5/12 + 4/12 = 3/4  
	+ 2/5 + 1/7 = 19/35  
	+ 5/7-1/7 = 4/7  
	+ 5/2 -1/4 = 9/4
	+ 1/3 - 4/7 = -5/21  
	+ 2/3 + 4 = 2/3 + 4/1 = 14/3  
	+ 5 - 3/4 = 17/4  
	
6.	**Dividing fractions**: Dividing by a fraction is really multiplying by its reciprocal!  
	+ **multiplication** of fractions. 3/5 x 3/4 = 9/20  
	+ **flip the second fraction**  
	+ 3/5 / 2/7 = 3/5 x 7/2 = 21/10  
	+ 2/9 % 1/3 = 6/9 = 2/3
	+ **Dividing** by a fraction is the same as **multiplying** by its **reciprocal** (of second fraction).  
	+ 4 % 1/3 != 1/12, its 4 x 3/1 = 12  
	+ 5/9 % 5 = 1/9  

7.	**Reciprocals**: A number’s multiplicative inverse is 1 over the number.  
	+ The **reciprocal** of a number is 1 divided by that number.  
	+ aka the **multiplicative inverse** (for a fraction, flip it over).  
	+ 7/4 is 4/7 & 1/8 becomes 8
	+ 2/11 is 11/2 = 5.5  
	+ 0.25 reciprocal is 1/0.25 = 4  

8.	**Mixed fractions**: Switching between mixed and improper fractions. 
	+ **mixed number, mixed fraction** is whole number and fraction together.  
	+ **Improper fraction** is Numerator greater than denominator.  
	+ 5/3 can be written as 1 2/3  
	+ 9/4 can be written as 2 1/4  
	+ 3 4/5 = 19/5  & 6 3/7 is 45/7  
9.	**Distributing division**: The distributive law works for multiplying, but also dividing.  
	+ same as distibutive law for division  
	+ (15 + 6) / 3 = 7  
	+ 15/3 + 6/3 = 7  
	+ (94-23)/ 7 = 94/7 - 23/7  
	+ 24/(6+2) != 24/6 + 24/2  
	+ if dividing by sum of numbers and distribustion is not allowded.  
	
10.	**When ‘of’ means multiply**: Evaluating fractions of numbers (like 5/7 of 210)  
	+ Each tickets costs $100. How much would **seven of them** cost?  
	+ 7 x 100 = 700, here 'of' represents multiplication  
	+ 9/4 x 200 = 450  
	+ what is 9/4 of 200? the answer is 450.  

### POWER AND ROOTS
1.	**Squaring a number**: Multiplying a number by itself.  
	+ 8 x3 = 24 ( 8 times 3 is 24)  
	+ 7 times 7 is 49 , multiplying same number " 7 squared equals 49"  
	+ 2 squared equals 4  
	+ Numbers like 49 and 4 that you get from squaring a whole number are called **square numbers**.  
	+ 0x0 =0, 1x1=1, 2x2=4, 3x3=9, 4x4=16, 5x5=25, 6x6=36, 7x7=49  
	+ 3x3 = 9 , "3 **squared** equals 9", "3 **to the second power** equals 9"  
	+ (-4)^2 is 16  
	+ 1.7^2 = 2.89  
	
2.	**Raising to powers**: Squaring, cubing, raising to the fourth, and so on…  
	+ 4^2 = 16  (4x4)  
	+ 4^3 = 64 (4x4x4)  
	+ 5^3 = 125  
	+ 3^4 = 81 ( 3 power 4; 4 is **Exponent** and 3 is **Base**)  
	+ **Exponent** is how many times is multiplied and the number 3 is **base**  
	+ real life example: under laboratory , bacterium doubles every hour.. you start withg one bacterium , if they **double** every hour, how many bacterium will there be after **seven** hours?  
	+ so the answer is 2^7 = 128  
	+ after 24 hours?? it would be 2^24 = 16,777,216  
	+ powers of negative numbers (-2)^3 = -2x-2x-2 = 4x-2 = -8  
	+ **Even powers are positive** and **Odd powers are negative** when its **negative base**  
	+ 2.4^4 = ?  
	
3. 	**Square roots**: Work backwards to find the number that was squared.  
	+ 6^2 = 36  ( 36 is square number)  
	+ **square roots works backwards**  
	+ *sqaure root of 36* equals 6  (**square roots** are positive )
	+ 6^2 = 36 and also (-6)^2 also 36  
	+ - *square root of 36* equals -6  
	+ Square root of a number's square is the same number.  
	+ *square root* of 4^2 equals 4  
	+ **Squaring** and **taking a square root** seem to cancel out..  
	+ **Square roots** are positive.  *sqaure root* of (-7)^2 = *square root* of 49 equals to 7 (positive).  (49 is square number)  

4.	**Roots of non-squares**: How to find the roots of numbers that are NOT square.  
	+ *square root* of 20 equals 4.472135955..  
	+ *square root* of 34 equals 5.830  
	+ use calculator  
5.	**Square roots of negatives**: Do negative numbers even have square root?   
	+ *square roor* of -16 equals ??
	+ negative number becomes positive in squaring    
	+ also (-4)^2 = 16 , 
	+ **Negative** numbers don't have square roots.  
	+ (Well actually, negatives have square roots that are **imaginary numbers.**)  
6. 	**Cube roots and beyond**: Cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots, and so on…  
	+ qube is ^3, *qube root of* 64  equals 4  
	+ *4th root of* 81  equals 3  
	+ *5th root of* 32  equals 2  
	+ *7th root of* 10,000,000  equals 10  
	+ *qube root of* 19 aproximately equals to somewhere between 2 and 3.  
	+ 2.66840165
	+ 2.668^3 = 18.99142...  
	+ square root of **negative** numbers are **not real**(thgey don't exist!)  
	+ but perhaps have qubes.  *qube root of* -8 equals -2.  (-2)^3 = -8.  
	+ All roots of **positive** numbers are **real** (they exist!)  
	+ but all **negative odd roots** are **real**  
	+ 
	
7. 	**PEMDAS**: Order of operations, now with exponents!  
	+ 4x(8-3+2) = 28  
	+ ( x / + -  PMDAS  
	+ PEMDAS is ( ^ x / + -  **Exponent**  
	+ 3^2 x (2^3 - 6) = 9 x(8-6_) = 18  
	+ (5+3)^2 = 64 & 5+3^2 = 14  
	+ (-4)^2 = 16  
	+ -4^2 = -16 
	+ *square root of* 3^2 - 5  plus(+) 4 = 6 , as 3^2 = 9 & 9-5 = 4, *square root of* 4 is 2 then 2+4 equals 6.

4.	**Distributing powers**: It works for multiplication and division, but that’s it!  
	+ (3x4)^2 = 3^2 x 4^2 = 9x16 = 144  
	+ **Exponents** can be **distributed** onto numbers being **multiplicated**  or **divided**

5. 	**Raising to the zero**: What happens when you raise a number to the zero?  
	+ When you **divide** powers with the same **base**, you can **subtract** their **exponent**  
	+ 3^7 / 3^5 = 3^2 = 9   
	+ 3^7 /3^7 = 3^0 = 1 
	+ Raising any number to a power of zero always gives you 1.  
	+ this applies to negative as well.  
	+ (-12)^0 = 1  & -12^0 = -1 here as per order of action.  
	+ 0^0 = 1  

6. 	**Negative powers**: What does it mean to raise to NEGATIVE exponent?

	+ Raising a number to a **negative power** equals **1 divided by** that number to the **positive power**  
	+ 7^-5 = 1/7^5  
	
7.	**Roots as powers**:  Taking a root is really the same as raising to power.  
	+ 9^1/2 = 3

	+ raising to the 1/2 is same as taking a *square root*  
	+ 9^1/2 equals *square root of* 9  
	+ raising to the 1/3 is same as taking a *qube root* 
	+ 8^1/3 equals *qube root of* 8  = 2  
	+ 64^1/3 equals *qube root of* 64  = 4  

8.	**Fractional powers**: What does it mean to raise to the 2/3 power?

	+ take base, raise to the power of numerator and take denominators root.  
	+ 16^3/4 = 16^3=4096^1/4 =4096^.25= 8  
	+ 243^2/5 = 243^2=59049^.20=9  
	+ 1^13/17 = 1^13=1^1/17=1  
	+ 10^2.489 = 10^2489/1000  
9.	**Distributing roots**: Roots are also exponents, so the same rules apply!  
	+ **Exponents** can be **distributed** onto numbers being **multiplied** or **divided**  
	+ (16x9)^1/2 = 16^1/2 x 9^1/2  is same as *square root of* 16x9 equals *square root of* 16 multiplies *square root of* 9.  
	+ *square root of* 7^2 x 5^2 equals 7x5 = 35 , (*sqaure root of* 7^2 is 7 and like wise).  
	+ *square root of* 8^2 + 6^2 = 10 and *square root of* 8^2 + *square root of*6^2 = 8+6 =14  (addition , substraction not applicable)  
	+ you **can't** distribute roots onto **addition!**  
	+ 
10.	**Simplifying roots**: Getting smaller numbers under the root.

	+  factor: x^2 +2x-35 
	+  (x+a) (x+b) = x^2 + (a+b)x + ab  
	+ hence (x+7)(x-5)  
	+ x^2-13x+42 == x^2 + (a+b)x + ab == a+b = -13 & ab = 42

	+ by dividing 2 both sides x^2 + 2x -4 = 0 ;  
	+ Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0  
	+ 2Ax = B = +- *square root of* B^2-4AC
