## GEOMETRY 
**The mathematics of lines, shapes, and angles. Essential stuff for describing the world around you.**

### LINES AND ANGLES
1.	**Lines, rays, & segments**: Learn about lines, rays, and line segments.  
	+ A **line** is a straight path that goes on forever in both directions.  
	+ made of lot and lots of dots.. Given two points P & Q, how many lines pass through both P & Q?  Ans : only 1   
	+ A line can be named after any two points on it.  arrow heads on top of it.  
	+ when points lies on the same line , they are called **collinear**  
	+ **Line segments** have **endpoints**. top of them with no arrow heads. 
	+ **Rays** go on forever in one direction. 
	+ 
2.	**Angles and degree**: Learn what angels are, and how to measure them.

	+ when two rays lies on each other, makes an angle.  
	+

	+ **positive rotation** counter clock wise and **negative rotation** clockwise.  
	+ 
3.	**Reflection**: Flipping across different axes (and the origin). 
	+ 
4.	**Dilation**: Stretching shapes in one or two directions.  
	+ Stretching the **same amount** in **perpendicular** direction  
	+ Dilating chnages size, not overall shape.  
	+ Dilation(scale) factors greater than 1 makes shapes larger and dilation (sclae) factor less than 1 makes shapes smaller.  
	+ 
5.	**Preserving congruence**: See which transformations keep things congruent.  
	+ translation, rotation, reflection .. 
6.	**Symmetry**: When reflection or rotation doesn’t change anything.  
	+ **Reflective symmetry**
	+ Axis of symmetery
	+ A regular polygon with N sides will have exactly N axis of symmetry  
	+ circle has infinity 
	+ **rotational symmetry** 
	+ What i sthe **smallest** rotation that return these shapes to their original position?  360/N - fold symetery  
	+ Pentagon 360/5 = 72, so each 72 degree smallest rotation

1.	**Why light bends**: Using Fermat’s principle to understand refraction.  
	+ **Fermat's principle** 
	+ **Refraction** The **bending** of light as it passes between different materials.
