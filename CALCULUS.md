## CALCULUS
**The mathematics of change. And it'll use just about every branch of math you've learned before it.**


### LIMITS
1.	**Limits to infinity**: What happens to functions as *x* gets really, really big?  
2.	**Vertical limits**: Sometimes *y* goes off to infinity.
3.	**Finite limits**: Limits when both *x* and *y* stay finite.  
4.	**One-sided limits**: Limits that come from only the left or right side.
5.	**Continuity (for real)**: Dive deeper into continuity, using one-sided limits.
6.	**Splitting limits**: Tricks for simplifying limits (and when they don’t work!). 


### DERIVATIVES
1.	**Tangent lines**: Finding the “slope” of a curve.
2.	**Drawing derivatives**: Learn what a derivative is, and draw your own.
